Package: aroma.agilent
======================

Version: 0.2.0 [2014-08-21]
o Now print() for AgilentDataFile reports on chip type, chip dimensions,
  barcode and scan date.
o Package now exports Package object 'aroma.agilent'.
o Made package build on more recent versions of R, e.g. adding
  a NAMESPACE file, properly importing functions etc.
o CLEANUP: Internal readColumnsFast() for AgilentDataFile would
  not close an open pipe to a system call.
o BUG FIX: getBarcode() and getScanDate() only worked if force=TRUE.


Version: 0.1.2 [2010-01-01]
o ROBUSTNESS: Using new Arguments$getInstanceOf() were possible.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all index arguments are validated correctly
  using the new 'max' argument of Arguments$getIndices().  Before
  the case where "max == 0" was not handled correctly.


Version: 0.1.1 [2009-11-10]
o Added exportCopyNumbers() to AgilentDataSet.
o Added testScripts/ directory.


Version: 0.1.0 [2009-11-07]
o Created.
